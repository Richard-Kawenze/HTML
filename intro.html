        <p>HTML images are definded with the img tag, and the file name of the image source is specified in the src attribute<br>
        if the image cannot be displayed, the alt attribute is used to specify alternative message to appear.</p>
        <img src="/home/ritchie/Downloads/chessking.jpg" alt="An image of the chess king" width="50" height="60">
        <p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element such as color,font,size and more as shown in the following paragraph</p>
        <p style="color:red;">This paragraph has been formatted using the style attribute</p>
        <p>The lang attribute is used to specify the language used in the web page. It is added just after the html tag</p>
        <p>Country codes can also be added in the lang attribute. example is: html lang="en-Us"</p>
        <p>The title attribute is used to define some extra infor. For example: move your mouse over the header below and see what happens</p>
        <p>The same applies to the paragraph below it</p>
        <p>the hr tag is used to draw and seperate lines as shown below using a horizontal line</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 title="I am a header">The title attribute</h2>
        <p title="I am a paragragh.">The title attrbute is very important</p>
        <p>In web pages, the display does not consider the line structure of the source code and the spaces between the individual lines.
            However, in some cases it is required to. eg. writing of a poem.
            This is where the pre element comes into play. It is used to define a preformatted text. As shown:
        </p>
        <pre>
            My boy lies over the ocean

            My boy lies over the sea 

            My boy lies over the sea
        </pre>
        <p>If the above paragraph was to be written like a normal paragraph, the lines would be in one paragragh</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">You can make the change the font size of a text using the style attribute</p
